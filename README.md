# Zomato Food Delivery Forecasting
### Description
This project aims to forecast delivery demand for Zomato, a popular food delivery service, using machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing historical delivery data, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, the project develops predictive models 
capable of accurately forecasting delivery demand. These models help optimize delivery operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve 
overall efficiency.

### Aim
1. The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model for forecasting delivery demand in the context of Zomato, a popular food delivery service.

2. By analyzing historical delivery data and leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to accurately predict future demand patterns. 

3. This will enable Zomato to optimize its delivery operations, allocate resources efficiently, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately improve overall service quality. 

4. Through the development of a robust predictive model, the project aims to provide valuable insights into delivery demand dynamics, enabling
Zomato to make data-driven decisions and stay competitive in the dynamic food delivery industry.
